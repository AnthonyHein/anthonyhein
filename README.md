Check out my personal website!: [anthonyhein.com](anthonyhein.com)

Proud lefty, duodecimal advocate, ordained minister, and riddle master with a
refuse-to-lose attitude inspired by the two-time failure of my driver's test.

I am a student studying computer science at Princeton University and working towards a certificate in statistics and machine learning. Outside of class, I am the treasurer of the Princeton PUZZLES club and Princeton Guitar Club. My professionalism has been cultivated through work with Pratt & Whitney, the U.S. Air Force Civilian Service, and Kessel Run (this is real, not just a Star Wars reference). On the side, I pursue several personal projects primarily using Python.

ðŸ™‚ Thank you and have an awesome day.
